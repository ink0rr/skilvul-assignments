              Create Minecraft Bedrock Addons using TypeScript. The purpose of this project was to make developing
              addons for Minecraft Bedrock easier. Bedrock Addons are made using JSON, so most of this projects are just
              type interfaces. But it also have a few other features like automatically generate language files,
              register textures in item_texture.json and terrain_texture.json, and few other things to take care about
              in making Bedrock Addons.

              Crafting Recipe Generator for Minecraft Bedrock. I made this project because usually, creating custom
              recipes in JSON is such a pain, we have to manually copy the pattern and set the ingredient names and item
              result while following our project documentation, which usually isn't always clear and consistent. This
              project aims to be used by the content team so that they can create custom recipes by themselves. They can
              get a shareable link to the recipe that they made and put it in the project documentation, so that us,
              developers, can just download from the link and use it.

              Various automation scripts to help making Bedrock Addons easier, like automatically fix geometry file name
              and identifier, creating and restoring Minecraft backup, automatically generate spawn egg texture based on
              the entity texture file, etc.
